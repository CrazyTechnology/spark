/**
 * Low-level task scheduler interface, currently implemented exclusively by
 * [[org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSchedulerImpl]].
 * 低级任务调度器接口，目前由 [[org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSchedulerImpl]] 独家实现。
 * This interface allows plugging in different task schedulers. Each TaskScheduler schedules tasks
 * for a single SparkContext. These schedulers get sets of tasks submitted to them from the
 * DAGScheduler for each stage, and are responsible for sending the tasks to the cluster, running
 * them, retrying if there are failures, and mitigating stragglers. They return events to the
 * DAGScheduler.
 * 该接口允许插入不同的任务调度程序。
 *每个 TaskScheduler 为单个 SparkContext 安排任务。
 *这些调度程序从每个阶段的 DAGScheduler 获取提交给它们的任务集，并负责将任务发送到集群、运行它们、在出现故障时重试并减少落后者。
 *他们将事件返回给 DAGScheduler。
