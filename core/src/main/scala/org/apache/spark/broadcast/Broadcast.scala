/**
 * A broadcast variable. Broadcast variables allow the programmer to keep a read-only variable
 * cached on each machine rather than shipping a copy of it with tasks. They can be used, for
 * example, to give every node a copy of a large input dataset in an efficient manner. Spark also
 * attempts to distribute broadcast variables using efficient broadcast algorithms to reduce
 * communication cost.
 *
 * Broadcast variables are created from a variable `v` by calling
 * [[org.apache.spark.SparkContext#broadcast]].
 * The broadcast variable is a wrapper around `v`, and its value can be accessed by calling the
 * `value` method. The interpreter session below shows this:
 *
 * {{{
 * scala> val broadcastVar = sc.broadcast(Array(1, 2, 3))
 * broadcastVar: org.apache.spark.broadcast.Broadcast[Array[Int]] = Broadcast(0)
 *
 * scala> broadcastVar.value
 * res0: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3)
 * }}}
 *
 * After the broadcast variable is created, it should be used instead of the value `v` in any
 * functions run on the cluster so that `v` is not shipped to the nodes more than once.
 * In addition, the object `v` should not be modified after it is broadcast in order to ensure
 * that all nodes get the same value of the broadcast variable (e.g. if the variable is shipped
 * to a new node later).
 *
 * @param id A unique identifier for the broadcast variable.
 * @tparam T Type of the data contained in the broadcast variable.
